RxDroid - A medication reminder
===============================

RxDroid is a simple medication reminder app. Apart from reminding you to take 
your meds, it will also keep track of your pill count, warning you to get a 
refill in time.

This app is free and open source, contains no ads, and requires only very 
limited permissions.
